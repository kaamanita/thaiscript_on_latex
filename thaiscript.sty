% Thai Script on LaTeX
%
% Description:
%     This script enables the usage of Thai script in a LaTeX document
%     while little to none modifications are needed in the source code.
% Author:

%
% Usage:
%
%     1. Create a new folder called `fonts`.
%     2. Upload the font of your choice to this folder. In most cases,
%        you may want to consider Sarabun on Google Font Collection
%        (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarabun?query=sarabun).
%     3. In your source code, place these lines in the preamble.
%
%            \usepackage{thaiscript}
%            \usethaifont{Sarabun}
%
%        Note that the font name `Sarabun` can be replaced by the
%        font of your choice.
%     4. Compile your source code with XeLaTeX. On Overleaf, please
%        configure your compiler by:
%            4.1 Click `Menu`
%            4.2 Go to `Settings` > `Compiler`.
%            4.3 Change it to `XeLaTeX`.
%     5. You can type in English and Thai texts without having to
%        use any specific command for a Thai text. The script will
%        detect Thai texts and switch to the Thai font automatically.
%     6. That's it. You can now use Thai script on your LaTeX document.
%
% Cautions:
%
%     1. Once you enable Thai script, the base line (size of text lines)
%        will be automatically stretched by 1.3 times to accommodate
%        Thai vowels and tone marks. If you don't want this feature,
%        please add this line right after the above two lines.
%
%            \renewcommand\baselinestretch{1}
%
%        This command will take the baseline back to normal.
%     2. Until now (June 2023), arXiv doesn't allow any submissions to
%        be compiled by XeLaTeX, disabling the use of this script as a
%        result. The current workaround is to write the content in
%        English as much as possible and to introduce Thai examples as
%        figures and illustrations instead. Apologies for any
%        inconveniences this may cause.
